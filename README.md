# NLP-and-Biodiversity-Assessment

In this project, I intend to leverage advanced **NLP techniques** to analyze the insights provided by experts in response to regional assessments carried out by **The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service (IPBES)**. The goal of this project is to explore the contributions that NLP can offer to the realm of biodiversity and ecosystem evaluation.

## Summary of Project 
The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service (IPBES), an intergovernmental body founded in 2012, has taken significant role in examining biodiversity trends and nature's contributions at regional and global scales. Notably, in 2015, IPBES initiated four regional assessments including Africa, the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia. These endeavors aim to strengthen the link between science and policymaking at the regional level.

A cornerstone of these assessments' credibility lies in the peer review overseen by the Multidisciplinary Expert Panel (MEP) of IPBES. Expert commentary offers insights into regional concerns and potential areas for practical action. However, a gap exists: these expert comments have not been systematically studied, either qualitatively or quantitatively.

This paper proposes an innovative approach: leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP)—a specialized branch of Machine Learning targeting language understanding—to undertake sentiment analysis and contextual semantic network examination of the expert comments, focusing on the Asia Pacific region. Using NLP techniques promises to shed light on predominant expert sentiments and key thematic concerns, potentially guiding future research and policy direction in biodiversity and ecosystem services.
